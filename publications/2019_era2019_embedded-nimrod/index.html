	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	
	<div id="abstract">
	
		<p>HTC (High Throughput Computing) is a class of research computing workload that typically consists of
of large quantities of small (CPU/memory) footprint, short-lived, independent jobs. The goal is to churn through
them as quickly as possible. Many HTC workloads involve parameter sweeps whereby the same processing
task is performed for a range of values of one, or more, input parameters. One example of this is
gathering a statistical sample by running the same stochastic task and collecting multiple outcomes.</p>
<p>HTC is generally regarded as different from HPC (High Performance Computing), due to its smaller footprint,
independence of tasks, and shorter walltimes. However, it is not necessarily a clear distinction,
because in some situations such as rapid design prototyping, a larger footprint HPC jobs could be
employed repeatedly with short walltimes to rapidly optimize a design.</p>
<p>Many of the common HPC workload managers, such as PBSPro, Torque, and SLURM, do not efficiently handle such
jobs. For jobs with walltimes in the order of minutes and seconds, scheduling and setup overhead can often
outpace the duration of the job itself. Job arrays are available to provide a more efficient way for handling
very large numbers of independent tasks; however, there is still an overhead associated with the commencement
and completion of each batch system job, or job array element.
They are also fairly limited in their support for parameter sweeps.</p>
<p>The independent nature of each job lends itself to the jobs becoming scattered across the HPC system.
Traditional HPC workloads required much larger chunks of computing resources and small footprint, short walltime
jobs can hold up the larger footprint workloads. From a resource management standpoint, it is more desirable to
consolidate fragmented workloads such as job swarms into a subset of the HPC resources and to better manage the
high turnover of tasks with a mechanism that has much more fine-grained control over the workload.</p>
<p>Embedded Nimrod is a software tool created to address this problem.
Instead of having to schedule the numerous HTC jobs through the existing batch system, only one is scheduled;
Embedded Nimrod handles the scheduling and execution from within this pool of resources.</p>
<p>Similar to its predecessor Nimrod/G[1], Embedded Nimrod is capable of elegantly handling parameter
sweeps. Yet it requires minimal changes to existing job submission scripts.</p>
<p>Embedded Nimrod has been used on the University of Queensland Research Computing Centre’s HPC clusters (including
Tinaroo, Awoonga, and FlashLite) and on Barcelona Supercomputing Center’s NordIII.
It has been used by several projects such as the Threatened Species Index, the first attempt to create an index
for threatened species in Australia[2], and for inland drayage research at UQ, i.e. optimising the transportation
of cargo containers inland from the Port of Brisbane[3].</p>
